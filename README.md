# There-Corrector

Built Python API using Flask that leverages Natural Language Processing through the NLTK library, and uses part of speech tagging to correct the use of "there", "they're", and "their" in sentences.

Chrome extension on client side allows users to input text, and subsequently calls the API to produce the corrected sentence.
